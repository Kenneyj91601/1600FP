#### Tips On Building Your Own Personal Computer!

## Kenneth Jackson

### This project will be a tutorial on how to build a computer that can be a great asset to your life and help you with everything that you may need and wish to create or achieve.

## The target audience for this tutorial are people who want a better insight on how to build the best computer/PC for their needs

### When building a brand new Personal Computer, these are the main components of the machine and with that comes a lot of choices on what will best suite your needs for the PC:

## COMPONENTS

#### CPU
#### Motherboard
#### RAM
#### Storage
#### PSU
#### GPU
#### I/O Devices

### CPU
This will be a very important part of building your PC, as the CPU will control how much your computr will be able to handle at once and possibly how fast your computer will run with more computationally complex programs. The CPU can be expensive depending on which you choose, but if you are needing a PC that can handle many big programs while also running smoothly, a more expensive CPU might be the way to go.

## Motherboard
The Motherboard can be an important component when choosing parts for your computer, since this is where all of the components begin to connect and actually start working together. Having a motherboard that is compatible with all of the components will be crucial becuase if not, then the PC will have no way of connecting all of the parts. Also, there are mother boards that are equipped to house even more equipment than  others, if one so chooses to add on to the power of their PC.

## RAM
The RAM of the PC is one of the most important parts of building a PC for someone looking to have big applications and programs running, possibly at the same time as others. This component controls how much memory the compouter has to hold the data needed for all open programs and applications, and even things that may be running in the background behind everything else. Having a higher RAM capacity will allow those same users to run everything at a much efficient, smoother pace and having the worry of crashes, overheating, or slow clock speeds be lessened due to the computer having more room to store more in-use data at a time. 

## Storage
The storage of the system is very important if you will have an abundance of data to store on your computer for long periods of time. For things like high-end content creation and games will require enough storage to store those potentially huge files. Since RAM is more for temporary storage, the main storage of computer will be able to store all of the data needed by you and the computer to keep efficient functioning, and having a safe place to keep your important documents and information.

## PSU
Finding a power supply unit possibly will not be much of a challenge, if you aren't a super computer that needs a hugh amount of energy/electricity to run. This will probably be one of the easiest components to shop for, given the low price and the fact that they don't really vary that much within the market, besides the amount of power it can handle. 

## GPU
This could possibly be the most important for a person looking to build a PC specifically for gaming for content creation. The GPU is like the CPU, only that it is soley focused on the graphics logic and working to display and maintain a consistent picture, usually needed most in the world of gaming. These devices can get very pricy, but these days, that is what it may cost to have high end graphics and be able to run many of the programs and applications being released today. 

## I/O Devices
Input/Output devices can be pretty expensive, like finding a good monitor or headphones. But, many of these devices can be smaller things like mouses and keyboards, or even usb drives. These things can also be upgraded later down the line much easier than any of the core components since a lot of these devices are mostly just Plug and Play
